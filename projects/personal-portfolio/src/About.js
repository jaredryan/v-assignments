                            <h3>Why Software?</h3>
                            <p>I discovered my love for computer science midway through my bachelor’s degree as a Bioengineering student at UC Berkeley. To me, it feels like solving a logic puzzle with the resources of a computer, and I absolutely love it. The discovery of computer science reinvigorated my studies, and consequently, I decided to focus my electives on it. Now, I am pursuing a career in it.</p>

                    <h3>My Values</h3>
                    
                    <p>Regarding my career, what I value most is self-improvement, organization, and teamwork.</p>
                    
                    <p>I'm a very game-oriented person: I enjoy sports, video games, and board games, and when I play them, I am constantly trying new strategies so I can get better. I find myself applying this same attitude to all areas of my life.</p>
                    
                    <p>This leads into the importance of organization: if I want to actually achieve this growth, it's essential for me to decide what exactly I want, make a plan, and have the determination to execute it.</p>
                    
                    <p>Lastly, I've found too that including the right people—with a little coordination—makes it not only that much easier to achieve that vision, but also enjoy the process.</p>

                    <h3>My Background</h3>
                    <p>It was too late to switch majors, so I studied what I could within the bioengineering program, and I ended up being one programming course short of a computer science minor, and two programming courses short of a major (too bad they don't let you switch majors last minute!).</p>
                            
                    <p>Instead of staying one more semester to get the minor, I decided to branch out on my own. Realizing how much I enjoyed web development, I decided to attend V School, a 12 week coding bootcamp with teaches Full Stack JavaScript (MERN) Web Development, and I'm loving every minute of it.</p>
            
                    <p>At this point as a recent college graduate, I've been programming for a couple hours every day for the past two years, and that has intensified in the past 8 months once I decided that software is what I wanted to do for a living.</p>

                    <h3>My Interests</h3>
                    <p>Growing up, I've been a very competitive person. I love games of all kinds: enjoy sports, video games, and board games. I'll take anyone on in a game of tennis, basketball, ping pong, Super Smash Bros., or Mario Kart. And I'll rarely turn down the chance to play any good board game with friends.</p>
                    
                    <p>Over time, I've mellowed out a little, learning to simply enjoy the company of my friends and family, go out in nature more, and kick back and watch a good movie.</p>
                    
                    <p>It's always been a dream of mine to travel the world; I'm currently in the process of planning that out. Any suggestions of where to go first are greatly appreciated!</p>
