# Mario Pest Control

This is the file associated with the Daily Planet Editor project, which can be found at https://coursework.vschool.io/mario-pest-control/.

I decided to create a separate repository for this project so it could be hosted on the web: https://jaredryan.github.io/basic-javascript-css-practice/ 

This is a project where we worked on HTML, CSS, and some very basic JavaScript. The user inputs how many creatures Mario caught and how much he should get paid for it. A form is used on HTML, and the information is retrieved using JavaScript. Calculations are done in JavaScript, then passed back into the HTML page.

I decided to take the time to make it look pretty good, except I did not spend a lot of time finding a pretty font.

I also made it responsive so it works well on any device with a screen the size of a desktop monitor to a phone.
