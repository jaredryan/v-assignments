Notes:

TODO
Use item isn't working
Inventory has a cap of 10 items.

LATER
Print messages for what the item does.

Define how I want to use the enemy.reward function. I must:
	1. Give the player health
	2. Give the player a random item
	*** Should I allow the player to level up? Create a player.levelUp() method, and keep track of experience points?

Update the array of enemies.
	+ Should different enemies be more common?

Find a way to always allow the user to print their current status.

Should players/enemies have defense as well?

Wrote an arbitrary reward function for the first enemy, need to do for all enemies.

Define a universal way to use items...
	1. Items cause damage
	2. Items can heal
	3. Items can help you run.
	4. Weapons? Defense? Magic/Special attacks?

What is my story?

Figure out how to incorporate walking/random fights into the game (w should mean to walk)
