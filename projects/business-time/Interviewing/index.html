		<h2>Interview Preparation</h2>
		<h3>You have the skills of a developer. You landed the interview. Now get an offer.</h3>
		<section>
			<h3>The Technical Interview</h3>
			<p>Software job interviews are their own beast, and the tech industry's greatest blessing and curse. You code in real time. The benefit for you is that your past experience is less relevant to finding a job than it is in other fields because they put a lot of stock into how you perform on their tests. This makes sense in some senses: the right coding questions make it quick and easy to determine who has coding experience, and who does not.</p>
			<p>On the other hand, proficiency at the type of coding questions they frequently use means developing a unique set of skills and proficiencies at solving a certain type of problem, which that may not be very important to you once you land a job. Regardless of how effective these technical interviews are at determining your potential proficiency at the position, they are used by nearly all tech companies. Therefore, it is essential that you prepare for the interview, and luckily for you, developing these skills opens doors to many different software positions.</p>
			<p>Technical interviews are comprised of two types of questions: conceptual questions and coding challenges.</p>

			<article>
				<h5>Conceptual Questions</h5>
				<img class="img-right" id="first" src="http://realizedconcepts.com/branding/realized_concepts.png">
				<p>Conceptual questions tend to pertain more to the specific job that you are pursuing, but general programming questions are also common. If your position will be in a specific language, they may ask you questions that pertain to the eccentricities of that language. Another example is if you were looking for a mobile development position, for example, you would know the basic rules of how an application is made and deployed on a mobile platform.</p>

				<p>As for general programming questions, common questions include: what is method overloading? What is inheritance? What is polymorphism? How does an array store information? How does a hash table work? Generally, if you have the experience, these questions will not be much of a problem. But, a little preparation always helps, especially if you tend to struggle more with nerves.</p>

				<h5>Coding Challenges</h5>

				<p>This is probably the most dreaded part of the job interview. However, similar to the conceptual questions, the types of questions tend to all be a certain subset of problems. In other words, this is something that you can study and practice until you will perform well on the interview for the majority of software developer positions, and that means the prepared will succeed.</p>

				<p>So how to prepare? First, learn how to approach problems effectively, then practice, practice, practice.</p>

				<h6>Approaching the Problem</h6>

				<p>This is taken straight from Cracking the Code Interview by Gayle Laakmann McDowell (link). This book is essentially the Bible for all aspiring developers. Anyways, the process she describes is as follows:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						<h6>Listen</h6>
						<p>Really listen to the problem. Make sure you understand it. If you don't ask questions to clarify; in fact, interviewers may intentionally leave the question vague so that you have to ask more questions to understand exactly what is going on. Also pay attention to the details; that often reveals the approach to the problem. For example, knowing if an array is already sorted or not could dramatically change the way you approach a problem.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h6>Example</h6>
						<p>Having a concrete example to play with often facilitates the thinking process. So, come up with it and use it as a reference to imagine a solution, and play out how your solution would work on this example. Below are a few tips for choosing an example.</p>
						<p>Don't choose an edge case--this means your solution will only work on a (potentially very small) subset of possible inputs. Think through it, and if your first example turns out to be an edge case, note it down to take it into account later. Then think of a new example.</p>
						<p>Make sure the example is the right size--large enough that you need to run through your code a few times and can be certain it will work, but not so large that it becomes tedious.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h6>Brute Force</h6>
						<p>It may be tempting to skip this step, but many developers will not be able to solve it with brute force, so this is a good place to earn points and get started. It often helps you to better understand and think through the problem as well.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h6>Optimize</h6>
						<p>Look for ways you can make your code run faster and using less memory. Generally, speed is more important than space, but do explain to your interviewer the tradeoff if you make such a choice. In particular, look to delete all unnecessary code, keep it DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself), and spend your time focusing on the bottleneck--the part of the code that takes the most time to execute. This will optimize your optimization process.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h6>Review</h6>
						<p>Writing code takes a lot of time, so make sure you are certain of your solution before you write code. Walk through and make sure that the variables are changing as you think it would, and that any loops, conditionals, or recursions act as you think they would.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h6>Code It Up</h6>
						<p>Type it up or write it down, as required by the interviewer. Write down beautiful code: follow the conventions of the language, good variables names, error/input checks, and using other function/classes if possible. The last part is important for writing clear, concise code.</p>
						<p>For example, write functions that do just one thing and do it well, and if you are working with a three-part problem, write a main function that will just run those three functions on your code to achieve what you want, rather than fitting them all into one function. If implementing one of those small functions is something out of your knowledge base or takes a lot of time, inform the interviewer and solve the rest of the problem the best you can. </p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h6>Test</h6>
						<p>Since time is limited, test it quickly to see if it works. Work through it conceptually and make sure everything does what you think it should. Check out any odd-looking code, such as a for loop starting at i = 1, just to make sure you accounted for that correctly. Check the usual problem areas, such as recursion, loops, null, integer division etc. Then run some test cases--check that it passes the edge cases (the empty array, 0, etc.) and that it works for a small test case that will utilize all of your code.</p>
					</li>
				</ol>
				<p>Lastly, throughout this entire process, talk through your thought process. The interviewer doesn't know what you're thinking unless you voice it, and the attribute they are hoping to gain from these challenges is really to just get a feel of how you think and overcome obstacles. This doesn't come naturally to most of us, so make sure to practice this, as well as the actual problems themselves.</p>
				<p>With this in mind, go and practice. Nothing teaches you how to code better than coding itself. As long as you have the tools and/or capacity to solve problems, gaining experience and struggling through them--that's how you really learn. So get cracking.</p>

			<h3>The Behavioral Interview</h3>
			<img class="img-right" id="third" src="https://fthmb.tqn.com/2MSvXtFODUNqI4Ju0Qssf6GcyAU=/1280x854/filters:fill(auto,1)/job_interview147205458-569fcc013df78cafda9e5f37.jpg">
			<p>Companies value certain traits in an employee. These do differ from company to company, but here are some traits that will certainly be desired:/p>
			<ul class="in-text-list">
				<li>
					<h6>Loves to code</h6>
					<p>Code often and post it on Github or some other platform. Real coders are always programming, always learning. Companies like to look on your profile and see how often you work.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h6>Curious</h6>
					<p>Similar to loving code is a passion for technology, a desire to constantly learn. Companies want employees who will learn on their own as their curiosity may unexpectedly benefit the company. For example, suppose a new language comes out that can greatly improve their product; the company may be unaware of the product but a developer may come across it and know how to use it because of their curiosity.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h6>Independent</h6>
					<p>Software developers need to have top-notch problem-solving skills. A developer's greatest asset is his or her ability to learn. When you experience difficulties, your ability to look things up and figure it out will be highly valued. Such challenges occur frequently with software, and companies want to know if you can rise to overcome those challenges.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h6>Confident in Your Skills</h6>
					<p>Own the fact that you are a developer. If you see an issue in a program or suspect that something will cause an issue, speak up! Don't let it slide. Your comment may save the company a lot of time, which may mean a lot of money. However, make sure to know where you knowledge ends, accepting the decisions of more senior developers if you are unsure, and learning from them when you can.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h6>Easy to Work With</h6>
					<p>If you're a nice person, that will take you a long way if you have the skills to go with it. Even if you are the most competent person out there, if working with you is difficult, people will not want to work with you regardless of the results.</p>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The best way to prepare for this portion of the interview is to work on developing these attributes themselves, and to prepare stories and questions that will show you have these attributes. Think of past projects you've worked on and how you exhibited these traits, and keep those stories in mind if your interviewer asks. Give them the context of the issue, how you solved the issue, and what the results were, and ensure that whatever trait or accomplishment you want to showcase shines through in that story.</p>
			<p>Regarding questions, prior to the interview, it is important that you do your homework on the company you are applying to. Doing so will allow you to come up with questions that will show that you are interested in the company, and it will help show how curious you are, or how interested you are in their company's line of technology. Both will earn you points with the company. Just remember to ask the questions with the intent of gaining knowledge, not showing off yours.</p>

			<h3>Conclusion</h3>
			<p>Software interviews are grueling, but you can prepare for them, which means that IF you put in the time to prepare, you WILL be able to land a job.</p>
