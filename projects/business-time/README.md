In this project, we suppose that we are starting a new business and need a website, and we are too broke to pay someone else to do, so we have to make it.

I decided to make my website to be a non-profit company that helps software developers become employed. As such, I decided to make its style similar to a coding text editor; however, I have mixed feelings about the results. Also, I spent a decent amount of time putting together the actual content for the website; however, that meant I spent less time working on the actual website. Despite that, it still is a classic static website with solid formatting, multiple pages, pictures, links, headers, and so on. It is also responsive, so it should work well on phones and iPads, as well as laptops and desktop computers.
