# Business Time

This is the file associated with the Business Time project, which can be found at https://coursework.vschool.io/business-time/.

In this project, we suppose that we are starting a new business and need a website, and we are too broke to pay someone else to do, so we have to make it.

I decided to make my website to be a non-profit company that helps software developers become employed. As such, I decided to make its style similar to a coding text editor; however, I have mixed feelings about the results. Also, I spent a decent amount of time putting together the actual content for the website; however, that meant I spent less time working on the actual website. Despite that, it still is a classic static website with solid formatting, multiple pages, pictures, links, headers, and so on. 

A project to practice making static websites, using various HTML and CSS techniques. It is also responsive. My project was more focused on compiling useful information for myself, since I decided that the website was about getting a software project.
