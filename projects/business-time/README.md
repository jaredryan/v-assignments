MAIN PAGE
	As main page shrinks, images should shrink too
	At a certain point, images should just be block as the text column wrapping it to the left or right becomes too small
FOR ALL PAGES
	Nav bar should no longer be fixed at the top for phones 
	Nav bar's links should be more presentable once the page gets too small for them

So, you want to get a job in tech? Here's the three things you need to focus on:

	1. Develop your skills [Insert Picture]
	Companies wnat talented individuals on their company, so developing your skills is most important. Code, code, code. Build something. Work on open source projects. Take a class. Real developers love to code and love to learn. Get in the habit now and you'll be surprised with where you are a few months down the road.
	2. [Insert Picture] Present Yourself and Make Connections
	In any industry, it's not enough to simply develop your skills; if you aren't able to convey that to your target company or to your interviewers, it will be impossible to get an interview, let alone a job. Learning how to present yourself will help you make a positive impression, which will open opportunities to network in the community; studies show that the majority of jobs come from a referall.
	3. [Insert Picture] Interview Preparation
	Lastly, interviews tend to focus on a small subset of problem-solving skills and basic data structures used in programming. Although these skills may not be used as often on your job, they dominant job interviews, so additional efforts should be made to prepare for these. Not to mention how to nail the behavioral portion of the interview.

Now that you have the skills to be able to succeed in a job in tech, it's time to attract employers. This section is all about helping you more effectively communicate your skills and other positive traits to employers so they know why they should hire you.

First, you need to reach out to companies so they know you exist. That means writing a strong resume, effective cover letters, and using other resources at your disposal, such as job-hunting websites. To succeed in this, you must:
	1. Understand what skills employees want
	2. Understand what traits employees want
	3. Write a resume conveying these skills and traits
	4. Write a cover letter conveying these skills and traits
	5. Use websites to expand your job search.

	In recent times, websites have become a more powerful resource for finding jobs: Indeed, LinkedIn, GlassDoor, for example. Many jobs are posted here, and your first step is to craft a resume and/or cover letter that will net you a job interview.

	Resources:
		Skills Employees Want
		Traits Employees Want
		Resume Tips
		Cover Letter Tips


Once you crafted your pitch, start networking. Attend meetups, conferences, and reach out to your friends and other connections. If you are prepared, you will be able to make connections that are the most powerful resources to finding your new job. This allows you to start in a better footing in the job interview process; almost, the majority of jobs are NOT posted online. That's right. Companies often fill jobs without posting them online because their employees often have friends who can fulfill the job requirements. Networking will open opportunities that you would never be aware of otherwise. The key steps here are the following:
	1. Go to events
	2. Talk to different people
	3. Get their contact information
	4. Follow up: send them an email to establish communication immediately after the event before they forget you
