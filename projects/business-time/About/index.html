			<h2>About Tech JobPrep</h2>
			<img src="http://clipartix.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Clipart-light-bulb-lit-clipartbold.png"/>
			<p>Tech JobPrep is a non-profit startup founded by Jared Ryan. As he prepared for the software developer job market after college graduation, he combed the internet, read a few books, and spoke to a few mentors for help in his job-hunt. He figured that others should benefit from his work, thus he decided to put this site together.</p>
			<p>The content is meant to assist those who seek jobs in technology by informing the reader, as well as offering some tips and guidance for how to use one's time effectively in this process. Note: he is still unemployed, so don't take his word for it; instead, read the linked resources and come to your own conclusions about how to proceed.</p>

			<h2>About Jared Ryan</h2>
			<p>Jared Ryan graduated from UC Berkeley in 2017 in Bioengineering. However, he realized quickly that a career in software would be immensely more fulfilling than one in other engineering fields. His love for games of all kinds—board games, video games, sports—has translated into a love of programming as he uses the logic of a computer to solve a problem. He is an aspiring software developer who has particularly enjoyed web development.</p>
