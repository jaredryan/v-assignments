            <p>Isn't it great to do something you can't fail at? As trees get older they lose their chlorophyll. With something so strong, a little bit can go a long way. If you overwork it you become a cloud killer. There's nothing worse than a cloud killer. Once you learn the technique, ohhh! Turn you loose on the world; you become a tiger. Trees get lonely too, so we'll give him a little friend.</p>
            <p>In this world, everything can be happy. Just let go - and fall like a little waterfall. Every day I learn. Let's put some happy little bushes on the other side now. Follow the lay of the land. It's most important. It looks so good, I might as well not stop.</p>
            <p>Now we'll take the almighty fan brush. Everyone is going to see things differently - and that's the way it should be. Nice little clouds playing around in the sky. Get away from those little Christmas tree things we used to make in school. I thought today we would make a happy little stream that's just running through the woods here.</p>
