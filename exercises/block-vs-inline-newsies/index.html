			<p><span>Step 1</span>- Avoid doing any and all homework until you are tired. Once you have reached sufficient exhaustion, only then can you begin your homework. The reason why this is the recommendation is because it is preferable that you use your energy for important matters, which include activities such as sports, video games, reading, hanging out, etc. Your interests require your full energy and attention and you must be at top performance in order to fully enjoy them. Once you have found that joy in your life, you may then move on to less important things, such as your homework. There’s no rush to begin such a boring task, after all.</p>

			<p><span>Step 2</span>- In order to complete your homework, you will most likely be required to use your computer. Before you begin, make sure all of the tools are set out, so that way when you are properly prepared, you can quickly get started. It will aid you in your process of doing homework. You can look to recent news articles for inspiration and also use the internet for research. Also, the games on the computer help to stimulate your mind in order to prepare it for work. Also, see the notes attached at the bottom for proper usage of your computer.</p>

			<p><span>Step 3</span>- This step is similar to step two. You want to set yourself for success and make sure everything is ready for when you decide it is time to begin. To make sure your brain has the tools it needs, you need to make sure that it has the energy it needs to function properly. Therefore, I propose that you fix yourself a something to eat. This can take the form of a meal or snack. Either will be sufficient to give your brain energy to process and do work. Once you have your brain food in front of you, you may proceed to step 4.</p>

			<p><span>Step 4</span>- Once your computer is out, you are exhausted, and have your reenergizing brain food, you must assess your objective. This requires you to bring all of your homework out. Analyze which homework will be best for you to work on at the moment. It is recommended that you begin on the easy work now and save the hard work for later. You do not want to discourage yourself from completing your homework by becoming stuck on the first assignment. The frustration can only exacerbate the situation. Also, some attempt to do it all at once, which is a wise approach if you can do it correctly. This allows you to divide your energy among the assignments, and allows you to complete your work in a timely manner.</p>

			<p><span>Step 5</span>- Now that your homework is all within sight and you think about your many assignments, you feel overwhelmed by all of it. This is the desired result. By realizing how much you have to do, you become more focused on finishing your homework. The clock is ticking, and you realize it. This forces you to face reality and puts the pressure on you to start right at this very moment. Once you feel this longing to be finished, you feel the necessity to begin your work right then and there, and you can proceed to the following step.</p>

			<p><span>Step 6</span>- So, you think you are finally prepared to begin? Think again. You are not truly ready to start. First, you must find something to distract yourself from thinking about your homework. Yes, this may seem ironic, but because you are overwhelmed and want to begin, it becomes clear that you cannot finish and be done with it as quickly as you hoped. You are not ready to hone down quite yet because your mind is playing tricks on you. Do not worry about that, however. That last step was required to build up the will power that you will need to finish your assignment. By distracting yourself, your mind will become carefree, and a mind without stress is a happy mind, and it tends to think more clearly. Wait until the time is right before striking, you must have the element of surprise on your side before attempting the assault on your work.</p>

			<p><span>Step 7</span>- All right, here it is, the moment we have been waiting for. Commence the attack on your homework. As discussed earlier, now that you have distracted yourself needlessly previously, your brain finally has the energy required to start the thinking process. It is stress-free, and the brain food that you digested the past hour is finally being converted to energy. Once again, analyze which assignment you are ready to begin. You may have thought that you knew which piece of homework you were ready to begin, but your mind has only begun to function as of these last few minutes. The decision you made earlier is most likely incorrect, so make a new decision. Once you are absolutely sure that you can do this assignment quickly and efficiently, then and only then can you begin working.</p>

			<p><span>Step 8</span>- This step is the art of “BS”ing. Of course, bs stands for bologna sandwich. Anyways, this consists of using fancy language that makes some sense, and by turning each sentence into a large paragraph on your homework assignments. At this point in time, the earlier steps will come into play once more. This is fine, do not worry, this is the cycle of procrastination. You will find yourself distracted and repeating your previous actions, which will be necessary if you want your brain to function properly by regaining strength and energy. Anyways, in the paragraphs, make sure to go outside of your comfort zone and use words that are sophisticated yet understandable and which have multiple meanings. Your project may seem a bit out there, but while your teacher is grading, they will see the logic within and reason to themselves that this paper is understandable when really it is something to the contrary and all together quite confusing. This strategy is especially if you have teachers that consider themselves smart because they do not want to be outsmarted by their student and “make sense” of a totally bizarre paper. Most likely their interpretation of your work will be completely off, but this is acceptable because it is likely that you do not understand your own work as well. Once you have finished the assignment, it is essential that you do not look it over afterwards: it is perfect “work” in its current condition.</p>

			<p><span>Step 9</span>- Once all analytical or self-reasoned analytical work is done, you may begin your busy work. Note that steps 8 and 9 can be interchanged as they both work well in succession to each other. Once your brain is tired and sore from thinking so much by turning its rusty gears, you may begin on this section of the homework since it does not require your brain to think. Similarly, if you began the busy work first, your brain still has the energy required to start thinking because busy work is that easy. So as you can see, these steps may be interchanged. Anyways, feel free to distract yourself once more during this session of homework. Rather than waiting for a recharge by distraction such as is the case during analytical work, you do not need your brain to do this work at all in the first place. Watch the television or talk with others during your homework so that you may entertain your mind while it is subconsciously doing your busy work.</p>

			<p><span>Step 10</span>- If you become too tired to continue, you have three options that you may choose from. First, you must reassess your energy levels. Find an activity that will stimulate you and energize yourself. This is achieved by regressing to many of the previous steps. Second, you may force yourself to go on. Think of yourself as the little engine that could, and push through exhaustion until your work is done. Third, give in to temptation. Lie down on the spot and have a cat nap. Close your eyes and relax for a maximum of 10 minutes and begin once more. Or, you may decide that you are done for the night or do not wake up from your little nap. In this case, wake up early in the morning, and you will have the energy needed to finish your work. However, you may have to push through as mentioned in option two despite having newfound energy. Also, if you are feeling like the singularly best procrastinator in the world, do your homework at school. Do it during lunch or a less important class. Nothing beats the satisfaction of finishing your work seconds before it is checked, passed, or turned in. However, by doing work during another class, you may fall behind in that class, which will begin the procrastinator’s cycle anew as you result to these techniques once more to finish your work.</p>

			<p><span>Note</span>: When in doubt of which step you are in, surf the internet or go on Facebook. The next step will come to mind eventually, and if you go to yahoo answers or Facebook, attempt to borrow answers from others or ask for advice. This may be achieved through begging, stalking, blackmail, or bribery. However this next part is crucial: do not work while waiting for answers. This act will become counterproductive if someone gives you the answers, so you do not want to waste your precious time and energy. Also, if you become exhausted and extremely bored of doing the same work with unnecessary repetition, Youtube is a nice tool for reenergizing your mind. Rejuvenation may be necessary at times and do not feel as if you must refrain from it. You may do this at anytime during this process, and is recommended while waiting for answers from others.</p>
